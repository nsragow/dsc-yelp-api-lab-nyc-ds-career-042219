    "# Yelp API - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how the Yelp API works and some basic Folium visualizations, it's time to put those skills to work in order to create a working map! Taking things a step further, you'll also independently explore how to perform pagination in order to retrieve a full results set from the Yelp API!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "* Create HTTP requests to get data from Yelp API\n",
    "* Parse HTTP responses and perform data analysis on the data returned\n",
    "* Perform pagination to retrieve troves of data!\n",
    "* Create a simple geographical system on to view information about selected businesses, at a given location. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now worked with some API calls, but we have yet to see how to retrieve a more complete dataset in a programmatic manner. Returning to the Yelp API, the [documentation](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) also provides us details regarding the API limits. These often include details about the number of requests a user is allowed to make within a specified time limit and the maximum number of results to be returned. In this case, we are told that any request has a maximum of 50 results per request and defaults to 20. Furthermore, any search will be limited to a total of 1000 results. To retrieve all 1000 of these results, we would have to page through the results piece by piece, retrieving 50 at a time. Processes such as these are often referred to as pagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will define a search and then paginate over the results to retrieve all of the results. You'll then parse these responses as a DataFrame (for further exploration) and create a map using Folium to visualize the results geographically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I - Make the Initial Request\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by making an initial request to the Yelp API. Your search must include at least 2 parameters: **term** and **location**. For example, you might search for pizza restaurants in NYC. The term and location is up to you, but make the request below."
